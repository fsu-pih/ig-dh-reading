# Maley, Corey - Analog and Digital, Continuous and Discrete

## Third DH Reading Group Discussion: Oct 9

### Terms used in discussion

Terms of Representation
- Analog
- Digital
	- discrete representations of quantity

Quantity
- Discrete
	- can be digital but not all
- Continuous

### Concepts to be expanded upon 
- Galloway's definition of analog and digital :
    - Galloway, A. R. (2019) “[Peak Analog](http://cultureandcommunication.org/galloway/peak-analog#more-1686),” March 22 blog post
    - Galloway, A. R. (2018) “[Episode 2: Defining the Digital](https://criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu/episode_2_defining_the_digital/),” October 23 WB202 podcast, Critical Inquiry
    
Connection to Roth
Digital
- numerical (mathematical) humanities
  - topics in Hamlet
- digital humanities

Moretti
- define how to quantify studies

### Discussion Questions
- translations of text? or just texts in general
- humanities studies? does the act of studying already create a digital representation? Can any version of humanities study be continuous?

Examples of continuous outside of humanities studies?
- no? examples of physics

Digital humanities
- everything is countable? this means its discrete
- principle component analysis of different topics? continuous
- where does consistency fit? fuzzy cloud - deep learning is not the same every time

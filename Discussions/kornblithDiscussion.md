### Free Form Notes: 

* Thesis: The mechanisms of reference in the case of artifactial kind terms might be different from those in terms of proper names and natural kind terms

#### 1. Real vs Nominal Kinds: from metaphysica to semantics

* nominal kinds - "the workmanship of the understanding" (not nature)
* arguments from ignorance
* arguments from error
* specific kind of chair -> specific to field of expertise

#### 2. Atifacts and Human Intervention

* nothing to do with semantics of artifactual kind terms

#### 3. Hidden Natures and Counterfactual cases

* Pluto = planet!

#### 4. Conclusion

* problems for ignorance and error

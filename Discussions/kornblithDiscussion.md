### Terms used in discussion

* Kripke-Putnam - causal historical

### Concepts to be expanded upon

* we don't have to start from scratch when talking about how to refer to artifacts 
* bring in the old stuff to adapt 

* we differ in opinion that this paper seems to be common sense (for the most part)

* in terms of metadata and the process of maintaining and creating collections for museum artifacts
	- division of linguistic labor depending on the archivist
	- in terms of digital artifacts

### Credit and Outside Resources

* Communities of Practice
	- i do this for a job and i need specific vocab to be a part of this community

	- requires understanding the theory behind it 
		- ex. machine learning to a computer scientist

* sociolinguistics - extra credit!

### For Paper: 

* Background
	- Kripke-Putnam 

* Models of Reference
	1. Descriptivism
		* descriptive content identifies particular objects
		- description matches real world thing
		- if accurate, then its a referential relationship
	2. Causal Model
		* chains of use back to baptism
		- baptism - when it happened the first time
		- coins a word, the unbroken chain of language user
		- refers to similar stuff based on history
	3. Character Model
		* regular rules of reference
	4. Intentionalist model
		* refer by intention to refer
		- intend on it to refer to one thing
		- its possible it doesn't, but that relationship exists now
		- potentially too simple

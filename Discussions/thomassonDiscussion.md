## Thomasson- Artifacts and Human Concepts

### Terms used in discussion

* prototype - intend to make something of a certain kind and you do not intend to produce something of an extent kind (not something that already exists that you know of)
* generally successful (non-specific, bothers Celine)

### Concepts to be expanded upon

- The process of creating a Kind (K)
1. Prototype
2. Artisans make kinds
3. "substantive idea" := "has to have enough features relevant to being a K, s.t. we can judge success" (bothers Gabi, ex plane - how much of it has to be different to be a diff kind of plane)
* ex. plane - features vs functions (Thomasson argument)

- can create a Kind across different cultures
	* relevant to mutiple discovery / simultaneous invention
	* ex. knife
		* if I want to make a knife but I dont know that knives exist 
		* same kind but different type of knife

* "something is a K only if it largely matches a substantive concept of some group of makers (minimally, its own)" pp 63

* 

### Discussion Questions

*  Can you accidentally invent something? Is it discovery? 
	* ex Flubber, absent minded professor
	- Thomasson would argue accidental discovery

- Design process - stanford encyclopedia of philosophy
- multiple discovery / simultaeous invention

- Sorites Paradox
	- some things are just vague - does not need to be specific

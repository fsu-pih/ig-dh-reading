# First DH Reading Group Discussion: Sept 25

## Roth, Camille. Digital, digitized, and numerical humanities

### Clarification of the Dichotomy

1. digitized
* Archives
* digital humanists

2. numerical
* computational social scientists

3. humanities of the digital
* critical biases examined in both
* socio-technical communities

### Terms used in discussion
* Continuous
	* There are no gaps - there is a point between any two points
	* synchronic
	* the set of real numbers
	* analog signal

* Discrete
	* There are gaps
	* The set of integers
	* digital signal (histogram-esc)

* Digital
	* pertains to digits
	* the act of storing data as 1s and 0s
	* tangentially related to computers but computers not necessary

* Analog
	* any variability in a representation means something


### Concepts to be expanded upon 

* 'humanities of the digital' as a bridge between the dichotomy
* three research programs of the same field
	* hard core values that need add ons but do not stray from core values
* the point of the article
	* ?that we need "humanities of the digital" to move forward as a field

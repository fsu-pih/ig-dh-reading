# "On the Place of Artifacts in Ontology" by Crawford E. Elder

## DH Reading Group Discussion: Jan 27

### Why this article/ discussion?

* "an artifact-free ontology is unnecessary and probably incoherent" pp34


### Terms used in discussion

(Background)
* ontology := what is there?
Principles of Ontology
1. Fundamentailty
2. Parsimony - least complicated possible (ontology is simple)
3. Ontological Commitment 
	- truthmakers

* Sellars
	- manifest image vs scientific image
		- artfacts only exist in the manifest image

* kinds
	- test how things break down into kinds 
	- natural kind (hydrogen) 
		- no overlaps or in betweens
		- they form heirarchies / trees
	- copied kinds
		- help us understand artifacts
		- not all copied kinds are artifacts but also not all artifacts are copied kinds
		- features
		1. "They are characterized by a particular qualitative makeup"
		2. members are produced by a process, which is a consequence, similarly shaped members carrying out their functions
		trans. artifacts have functions, as they do - they are replicated as a consequence of their function
		3. They have a historical proper place
	- DEFINITION
		- kinds have an essence
		- essence - non-accidental clusters of properties unique to one and only one kind
			- Identity of Indiscernables 


* Protect common sense until we don't have to
	- can get a lot of things wrong bc reality does not need common sense to work

* projectivism
	 - attributing qualities to object as if it has these properties (wikipedia)

### Concepts to be expanded upon

* Artifacts can be alive
	- ex. synthetic biology
	- xenobot... robot combined with synthetic biology
	- can traditional artifacts be living?
		- cellular atomata

* size in terms of artifacts
	- portotypically medium
	- in comparison to humans
